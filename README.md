# pd2jira

Create JIRA tickets when a PagerDuty incident is triggered.  This is a small script that will translate PagerDuty's webhooks to emails to become JIRA tickets.  You can host this yourself and you will need to populate the variables at the beginning of the PHP script.

For a full walkthrough on setting up the integration, please visit the integration guide [here](http://www.pagerduty.com/docs/guides/jira-integration-guide/)
